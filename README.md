## ‚öôÔ∏è HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE CODE

### üíæ Save the File
Save your source code with a `.c` extension.

Example:

---

### üß± Step 1: Compile the Program
Run this command in your terminal:
gcc "file.c" -pthread -o dot

```bash
gcc dot_productthread.c -pthread -o dot
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 2: Run the Executable File

After compilation, run the executable:
```bash
./dot
```





## üìò Brief Description

The **Open-Ended Lab (OEL)** in the Operating Systems course allows students to apply theoretical concepts in a practical way.  
In this particular OEL, we implement a **Parallel Dot Product** program in **C** using **POSIX Threads (pthreads)**.  
The goal is to understand **multithreading**, **mutex locks**, and how **race conditions** can affect shared data in concurrent execution.
