## 📘 Brief Description

The **Open-Ended Lab (OEL)** in the Operating Systems course allows students to apply theoretical concepts in a practical way.  
In this particular OEL, we implement a **Parallel Dot Product** program in **C** using **POSIX Threads (pthreads)**.  
The goal is to understand **multithreading**, **mutex locks**, and how **race conditions** can affect shared data in concurrent execution.
